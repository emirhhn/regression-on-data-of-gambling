I am working on a project in which I am investigating data on gambling addiction and its graphs. So, I use machine learning to see what could be amount of money that will be spent in next years and show this data to people in a way they can easily understand. I use matplotlib for sketching predicted graphs. In this project, Linear and polynomial regression methods are used.
